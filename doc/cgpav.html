<b>Description</b>
<p>
  Free Clamav Anti-Virus, Kaspersky Anti-Virus (AVP), Sophos Anti-Virus,
  Trend Micro, Dr.Web and
  SpamAssassin Anti-Spam External Filter (Plugin) for CommuniGate Pro.
<p>  
  It is used to scan all e-mail messages that are transferred via
  CommuniGate Pro mail server

<p>  
  The main distribution site for cgpav: 
  <a href="http://program.farit.ru"><b>program.farit.ru</b></a><br>
  The first versions of cgpav were developed and supported by 
  Damir Bikmuhametov: 
  <a href="ftp://bfm.bashnet.ru/CGPAV"><b>ftp://bfm.bashnet.ru/CGPAV</b></a>

<p>  
<b>How it works</b>
<p>
  The program reads requests from its standard input in the form:<br>
	seqNum FILE fileName<br>
  for example:<br>
  1111 FILE Queue/111111.msg
<p>
  Then it parses the line and adds a new element into the query list structure,
  containing seqnum and filename. The program creates child process for
  every element from the list that sends request to anti-virus daemon through
  the socket and waits for result. It sends file name to scan, constructed
  as cgpro_home + / + filename.<br>
  The number of child processes depends on the number of Enqueuer processors in
  CommuniGate Pro settings and the value of max_childs in the
  configuration file <a href="cgpav-conf.txt">cgpav.conf</a>. These
  numbers must be equal and &gt; 1. 10 is a good choice.
<p>
  Depending on the anti-spam and anti-virus response code the program prints out to 
  the standard output different responses.
<p>
  When a message is not infected and it is not spam it prints:<br>
  seqNum OK<br>
  Also it answers OK in all &quot;difficult&quot; situations:
  timeout while virus scanning, anti-virus or anti-spam daemon is not responding, 
  etc.
<p>
  When a message is infected the program prints something like:<br>
  seqNum ERROR "WARNING! Your message is infected by VIRUS: I-Worm.Sircam.c"<br>        
  When a message is detected to be spam it prints:<br>
  seqNum ERROR "You are a known spammer.\\nYour message was rejected"<br> 
  When CommuniGate Pro receives such a response, it creates the 
  Undeliverable message that includes the text sent in the program response.                 
<p>
  It can also silently <b>DISCARD</b> messages without delivering
  to recipient, <b>ADDHEADER</b> - add special headers when virus or spam
  were detected allowing an end user to filter such messages in his own
  mail program. Certainly, no one normal user want to receive viruses,
  so you should choose reject or discard actions for infected messages.
  But the program can mark some &quot;good&quot; messages as spam, so 
  it's better to leave the final decision to end users by defining
  addheader for spam_action. There can be problems, however, with some 
  strange mail clients like Microsoft Outlook Express that can't filter 
  mail headers. In such case, a user can add the Rule to store all messages 
  containing the above mentioned header into special folder. He can then browse 
  this folder using IMAP or through the webmail interface.
  
<p>
  Also the program can send additional notification messages about infected
  messages to its sender and recipients by writing 
  notification messages to the Submitted CommuniGate Pro directory. PIPE
  module of CommuniGate Pro scans this directory periodically and sends
  all messages from it. <br>
  You can enable including notification text on several languages 
  messages in the configuration file.<br>
  Also it can send notifications to the postmaster of the whole mail server
  and postmasters of virtual domains.  
<p>
  When there is some temporary mulfunction in the program it prints 
  something like:<br>
  seqNum REJECTED "Antiviral filter unavailable. Will try later"<br>
  This situation can happen, for example, when daily virus base updater 
  script reloads the anti-virus daemon.<br>
  The mail message is not rejected itself, it is stored in the CommuniGate Pro 
  queue for the further processing.
<p>
  If the sequential count of REJECTED messages exceed max_errors parameter 
  from the configuration file, the program will answer OK until 
  the anti-virus daemon will start functioning.            
<p>
  cgpav uses the standard spamd SpamAssassin daemon. Default action is
  adding the header X-Spam-Status: Yes to messages when spam score
  exceeds required_hits.
  Users then can filter such messages in their mail clients or create a
  rule in CommuniGate Pro to store them in a special folder.
<p>
  Moreover, you can define another action when score is more than 
  extra_spam_score, e.g. discard (silently remove messages).
  It's rather high and is useful in cleaning your mail server from 
  the obvious spam as most users do nothing in order to use the above 
  mentioned header.      
<p>
  Example of the web-interface for users is included. Users can
  customise spam hits, actions, disable some tests and can create
  a Rule to store identified spam in the special folder. 

<p>  
<b>Installation</b>
<p>
  Unpack the source:<br> 
        gzip -cd cgpavXXX.tar.gz | tar xvv-    
<p>
  Run ./configure
<p>
  You can change parameters by using the options:<br>          
  --with-antivirus=av_name      Anti-virus daemon name: 
  [avp OR sophos OR clamav OR trophie OR drweb OR no]<br>
  --with-spamassassin=yes/no    Use SpamAssassin filter or not<br>
  SpamAssassin user profiles can be stored in a database,
  you can choose MySQL or PostgreSQL (require headers and libs)<br>
  --with-mysql=yes/DIR		path to the MySQL root dir<br>
  --with-pgsql=yes/DIR		path to the PostgreSQL root dir<br>
  Though configure tries to find database dirs itself.<br> 
  --with-cgpro-home=PATH        path to the CommuniGate Pro root dir 
				[/var/CommuniGate]<br>
  --with-cgpro-settings=PATH    path to the CommuniGate Pro Settings dir 
				[cgpro-home/Settings]<br>
  --with-cgpro-submitted=PATH   path to CommuniGate Pro Submitted dir 
				[cgpro-home/Submitted]<br> 
<p>
  For example:<br>
        ./configure --with-antivirus=clamav
<p>  
  If you don't define options to configure, it will ask you to choose
  options from menus.    
<p>  
  Then:<br>
        make<br>
        make install    
<p>  
  The program executable cgpav will be installed into the cgpro_dir,
  mentioned above and the configuration file cgpav.conf - to
  the dir Settings inside this root dir.
<p>  
  Certainly, you may not type make install and copy these files
  elsewhere yourself.
  
<p>  
<b>4. Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam daemon installation</b>
<p>
  Get the sample virus from 
  <a href="http://www.eicar.org"><b>www.eicar.org</b></a>    
<p>
  Run Install in kavdaemon or sophos distributions, following the
  instructions.   
<p>
  <b>CLAMAV:</b>
<p>
  Some Linux (.deb and .rpm) and other Unix distributions have 
  clamav in their distributions. But you can easily download it
  from <a href="http://www.clamav.net"><b>www.clamav.net</b></a>,
  then run ./configure, make, make install.<br>
  Edit clamav.conf appropriately, we will use only Local Socket.
  Check that LocalSocket value corresponds to the clamd_socket value
  in cgpav.conf.<br>
  Also check the user running clamav, it must be root or a user
  from the group 'mail' who has access to the /var/CommuniGate dir.<br>
  User root<br>
  Uncomment the option ScanMail in the clamav.conf<br>
  Run clamd daemon and clamdscan to check for the sample virus.
      
<p>  
  <b>KASPERSKY (kavdaemon):</b>
<p>  
  Insert path to the Communigate Pro Queue directory into the AVP daemon 
  start file (/etc/init.d/kavdaemon) parameters like:<br> 
  DPARMS="-I0 -Y /var/CommuniGate/Queue"<br>
  Inserting path there allows AVP to check that directory against viruses 
<p>  
  Or add this path into the AvpUnix.ini or defUnix.prf section
  [Object]->Names with the star sign in front of:<br>
  Names=*/home;*/var/CommuniGate/Queue<br>
  (Don't forget to add * to activate this path)
<p>  
  Run kavscanner to find the sample virus.
<p>
  <b>SOPHOS:</b>
<p>  
  Create group sweep and user sweep.
<p>  
  Installer can not find some environment variables like MANPATH, 
  set them:<br>
        MANPATH=&quot;$MANPATH:/usr/local/man&quot;<br>
        export MANPATH     
<p>
  Create symlink:<br>
        ln -s /usr/local/lib/libsavi.so.2 /usr/local/lib/libsavi.so
<p>
  Run sweep to find the sample virus.
<p>  
  Then you must install and run &quot;sophie&quot; 
  <a href="http://www.vanja.com"><b>www.vanja.com</b></a> 
  - sophos based anti-virus daemon.
  Follow instructions for it.<br>
  As at the time of writing run ./configure, copy sophie.cfg and 
  sophie.savi into /etc and edit them. sophie.savi.individual 
  would be a good example for sophie.savi
  <br>
  I recommend to change user and group in sophie.cfg to root or
  the user your CommuniGate Pro works under.
<p>
  You can compile scan_file.c in sample_appls/sock to test the daemon.
<p>
  Then add an entry into cron to run sophosupdate.pl daily or more often.      
<p>
    <b>TREND MICRO:</b>
<p>
    Place libvsapi.so and pattern file into /etc/iscan dir. They
    can be downloaded for evaluation 
    <a href="http://www.antivirus.org"><b>www.antivirus.org</b></a> <br>
    Download Trophie daemon 
    <a href="http://www.vanja.com"><b>www.vanja.com</b></a><br>
    ./configure --with-user=root --with-group=root<br>
<p>
    <b>DR.WEB:</b>
<p>
    In the file /etc/drweb/drweb32.ini set path to Unix socket:<br>
    Socket=/var/run/drwebd.socket<br>
    Run drwebdc to check functioning of the drwebd daemon.        
    
<p> 
  <b>SPAMASSASSIN:</b>    
<p>
  If you want to install SpamAssassin, download it from 
  <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org"><b>www.spamassassin.org</b></a>.      
<p>
  Compile it:<br>
  perl Makefile.PL<br>
  make<br>
  make test<br>
  make install
<p>
  Or download rpm or deb package for your distribution.
<p>
  Test it by running:<br>    
  spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > sample-spam.txt<br>
  spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > sample-nonspam.txt    
<p>
  Check if sample-spam.txt marked as being spam message. 

<p>  
<b>Configuration</b>
<p>
  Configuration file <a href="cgpav-conf.txt"><b>cgpav.conf</b></a> 
  must reside in /var/CommuniGate/Settings,
  /var/CommuniGate or /etc directories.<br>
  The program first scans /var/CommuniGate/Settings directory, then 
  /var/CommuniGate and /etc, it will use the first found cgpav.conf.
  You can change this behaviour by editing cfg.c source or by adding the option
  -f while running cgpav:<br>
  ./cgpav -f /var/elsewhere/cgpav.conf
<p>    
  If the program can't find any cgpav.conf or if you omitted some
  required parameters in it, it will use defaults from
  cfg.h
<p>  
  Most values in cgpav.conf are good for standard cgpro and anti-virus
  installations. If you use database profiles, set the password of a 
  database user.

<p>    
<b>Testing</b>
<p>
  You may save some time if you first configure cgpav in the DEBUG mode:<br>
  CFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG" ./configure<br>
  cgpav will show much more additional information in such mode, and it
  works in one-process mode.<br>
  Don't forget to reconfigure it then back:<br>
  ./configure    
<p>
  Copy some file with virus (named, for example, eicar.com)
  to the /var/CommuniGate directory.
<p>   
  Run Filter from the command line by typing ./cgpav<br>
  Then enter something like:<br>
	1 FILE eicar.com
<p>  
  If you see something like<br> 
	1 ERROR &quot;WARNING! Your message was infected by VIRUS: 
	EICAR-AV-Test&quot;<br>
  then cgpav works fine.
<p>  
  If you see only<br>
	1 OK<br>
  then the program doesn't find viruses. 
  
<p>  
  Kaspersky:<br>
  First look into the log file of kavdaemon (/root/kavscan.rpt).
  If you see that kavdaemon have found the virus you can uncomment
  the response line in the function avp_scan_file in avpcomm.c file.<br>
  In Linux responses are: 0x134 (octal) for infected and 0x130 for good.
  In Sparc Solaris: 0x1340000 and 0x1300000
  
<p>    
<b>Installation into CommuniGate Pro</b>
<p>
  Check documentation from their site: 
  <a href="http://www.stalker.com"><b>www.stalker.com</b></a>
  
<p>  
  SETTINGS->Rules<br>  
  Priority Name<br>
  10       virus scan
<p>  
  Click to Edit<br>
  Data<br>
  Message Size greater than 1024
<p>  
  Action<br>  
  ExternalFilter     		
<p>
  Go to the Settings->General->Helpers<br>
  and in the menu Content Filtering add path to the program
<p>  
  Mark   Content Filtering<br>
  Program Path: cgpav<br>
  if it is located in the CommuniGate Pro home directory 
  or write here the absolute path to it.
<p>
  Leave parameters &quot;Time-out&quot; and 
  &quot;Auto-Restart in the new versions of CommuniGate Pro disabled.<br>
  Change them only if cgpav crashes. Certainly, cgpav is made to be
  very reliable and to avoid crash problems.

<p>
<b>Configuring SpamAssassin</b>
<p>    
  SpamAssassin test is disabled by default. You must be very careful
  with it as it can reject some useful mail. It's not the
  5 minute work!
<p>
  After installing SpamAssassin you must fire up some fast database.
  MySQL <a href="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</a> is the best
  choice, also PostgreSQL is supported. You have to install 
  libmysqlclient-dev or postgresql-dev package, or have headers and libs.
  Also install Perl DBI and DBD modules for your database.<br>
  Here we will mention only the use of MySQL, you must adjust 
  the configuration for another database.    
<p>
  We store every user's own preferences in the database.<br>
  Connect to mysql as root:<br>
  mysql -u root -p<br>
  and create the new database named, for example, spamassassin:<br>
  mysql>CREATE DATABASE spamassassin;<br>
  Then create and grant priviliges to the user named, for example, 
  spamassassin:<br> 
  mysql>GRANT ALL ON spamassassin.* TO spamassassin@localhost IDENTIFIED
  BY 'secretpassword'; <br>
  Certainly, secretpassword must be your own password.<br>
  Exit from the database.   
<p>
  Then create the table userpref:<br>
  CREATE TABLE userpref (<br>
  username varchar(100) NOT NULL,<br>
  preference varchar(30) NOT NULL,<br>
  value varchar(100) NOT NULL,<br>
  prefid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,<br>
  PRIMARY KEY (prefid),<br>
  INDEX (username)<br>
  ) TYPE=MyISAM;
<p>
  You can find the file userpref.sql in the directory spam/sql.<br>  
  Run from the command line:<br>
  mysql -u spamassassin -p spamassassin &lt; userpref.sql
<p>
  Download and compile DBI and DBD Perl modules for your database
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a>. 
  Or install them from packages or rpm. 
<p>
  Go to the spamassassin configuration directory: /etc/mail/spamassassin or
  /etc/spamassassin. Add to the local.cf file these lines:<br>
  <table border="0">
  <tr><td>user_scores_dsn</td><td>DBI:mysql:spamassassin:localhost</td></tr>
  <tr><td>user_scores_sql_username</td><td>spamassassin</td></tr>
  <tr><td>user_scores_sql_password</td><td>secretpassword</td></tr>
  </table>
  Parameter user_scores_dsn must be in the form:<br>
  user_scores_dsn                 DBI:driver:database:hostname[:port]<br>
  Adjust it for your own database.
<p>
  If you'll use spamd on the localhost, it's better to connect to it 
  through the unix socket. If it's installed on the other, use the tcp socket.
  Set the appropriate value in cgpav.conf:<br>
  spamassassin_socket_type = unix<br>
<p>
  If you use the unix socket, set running parameters for spamd like:<br>
  -d -m 10 -x -q -u mail --socketpath=/var/run/spam<br>
  In case of the tcp socket:<br>
  -d -m 10 -x -q -u mail -i spamd.daemon.ip -p 783 -A your.mail.server.ip<br>
  Where spamd.server.ip - IP-address of the spamd server,
  your.mail.server.ip - IP-address of your mail server from which it connects
  to the spamd server. You can set several IPs separated by comma. 
<p>
  Check spamd with the help of the spamc program:<br>
  spamc -U /var/run/spam < sample-spam.txt > sample-spam.log<br>
  I recommend you to add -D (debug) option to the spamd parameters,
  it will give detailed information in log files.            

<p>
  Create the file 50_whitelist.cf in the SpamAssassin's configuration directory
  and add domains of your trusted neighbours:<br>
  whitelist_from  *@*.gooddomain.com
<p>
  You can also create the 50_blacklist.cf file to add the known spammer
  sites:<br>
  blacklist_from *@flowgo.com<br>
  Good blacklist can be found here: 
  <a href="http://www.stearns.org/sa-blacklist/">www.stearns.org/sa-blacklist/</a>
<p>
  You can even create your own rules using the regular expressions.
  Note: scores may be negative.
  File 55_head_tests_my.cf:<br>  
  <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>header MY_GIRL</td><td>Subject =~ /my.{1,15}darling/i</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>describe MY_GIRL</td><td>Subject: That's my dear girl</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>        
    <td>score MY_GIRL</td><td>-10.0</td>
  </tr>
  </table>      
<p>
  File 55_body_tests_my.cf:<br>  
  <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>body MY_BOSS</td><td>/Your.{1,15}boss/i</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>describe MY_BOSS</td><td>Boss want something again</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>        
    <td>score MY_BOSS</td><td>3.0</td>
  </tr>
  </table>      
<p>
  Set up the interface for user self-adjustment of spam actions, required_hits, 
  white and black lists. An example for php available in the spam/www/php
  directory. It will authorize against CommuniGate Pro on the 106 port.
  You can use any other tool or interface that can manipulate the 
  database. <br> 
  Note: you must always insert the full user's
  e-mail address into the username field, not just his name. 
  jeorge@domain.com is correct, jeorge is incorrect.

<p>
<b>Known problems</b>
<p>    
  If you disable-enable antivir in Content Filtering in 
  CommuniGate Pro   Settings->Helper Settings, the old cgpav
  process becomes zombie.
<p>  
  Don't worry. You must reload CommuniGate to kill them.
  
<p>  
<b>Licence</b>
<p>
  The program is licenced under GPL.
<p>  
  Certainly, you must get your own licence for commercial Anti-Virus daemons.  
<p>    
<b>Suggestions for Kaspersky</b>
<p>
  Again, add path to CommuniGate Queue directory into Anti-Virus 
  starting script (/etc/init.d/kavdaemon) and into Antivirus Base
  updating script (/opt/AVP/kavupdater.sh or cron script) parameters:<br>
	DPARMS=&quot;-I0 -Y /var/CommuniGate/Queue&quot;<br>
  Or simply add path into AvpUnix.ini [Object]->Names with star * sign 
  in front of.  
<p>  
  Insert UpdatePath line into AvpUnix.ini to allow downloading
  of virus updates (Can be run daily by cron):<br>
	UpdatePath=ftp://ftp.kaspersky.ru/updates/<br>
  Or use another ftp-site from the Updates.lst file.	
<p>
  Don't waste resources by changing parameter -I0 (just scan for viruses)
  to -I2 (virus curing). Files in messages are packed by MIME and 
  Anti-Virus can't cure them. Also CommuniGate doesn't like when somebody
  changes the size of posted messages.
<p>
  Please, change this setting in defUnix.prf:
<p>  
  [Options]<br>
  ParallelScan=Yes
<p>  
  [Report]<br>
  Report=No    
<p>
  Enable reporting only on the testing stage.
<p>  
<b>Suggestions for Sophos</b>
<p>
  I included the virus IDE updater script sophosupdate.pl 
  You might not have some Perl modules to run it, for example,
  Archive::Zip. Download them from your OS's distribution site or
  from <a href="http://search.cpan.org"><b>search.cpan.org</b></a>

<p>  
<b>Suggestions for SpamAssassin</b>
<p>
  In the cron  directory you can find the program delete_old_mail, 
  using which you can automatically delete messages from the Spam
  folder where spam messages are stored.<br>
  Required module CLI.pm can be found here: 
  <a href="http://www.stalker.com/CGPerl">www.stalker.com/CGPerl</a>

<p>        
<b>How to check messages for other servers in domain</b>
<p>
  For example, you have the server mail.domain.ru with installed
  virus filter and you want to protect another mail server
  alpha.domain.ru.
<p>  
  In Settings->Router add the line <br>
  Relay: alpha.domain.ru = alpha.domain.ru@alpha.domain.ru.25.smtp
<p>
  In DNS record add MX lines:
<p>

 <table border="0" cellpadding="7">
 <tr>
  <td>alpha</td><td>IN</td><td>MX</td><td>10</td><td>mail.domain.ru.</td>
 </tr><tr>  
  <td>&nbsp;</td><td>IN</td><td>MX</td><td>20</td><td>alpha.domain.ru.</td>
 </tr>
 </table> 

<p>			
<b>Logging</b>
<p>  
  The program log information about all messages with viruses
  using the standard syslog local0 facility.<br>
  You can find log lines in the main syslog file:<br>
	Jan  1 00:00:11 mail cgpav: Virus: I-Worm.BadtransII  
	From: anna@mail.host.ru  To: antivirus@test.ru
<p>  
  You can change parameter log_facility in cgpav.conf 
  to use another logging facility (mail, local0 - local7)
<p>  
  If you want to redirect all antivirus messages somewhere else you can
  do it by editing the file /etc/syslog.conf<br>
	local0.*			-/var/log/virus.log
