 1.5  (01.07.2010)
--A new action for SpamAssassin - addheaderjunk. Thanks to Philipp Hellmich.
  When selected, it adds
  the header 'X-Junk-Store' that can be used in the cgpro rules.
  The higher the spam score, the more Xs will be added to the header.
--Eliminated compiling the deMIME library for Clamav because it supports the cgpro format itself.
  Though, it will eliminate the file extension checks.


 1.4  (01.09.2005)
--As Clamav > 0.80 understands the Cgpro mail format,
  saving attachments into temporary files and scanning them 
  was disabled. 
  Enable the ScanMail directive in the clamav.conf file
--max_childs check was disabled for Solaris because
  there is a problem with SIGCHLD.

  added -lz in configure to solve MySQL compiling error on some platforms

--discard_infected and discard_spam in cgpav.conf are deprecated, use
  infected_action and spam_action instead.
  Actions are: none - do nothing, reject - bounce message,
  discard - delete message silently, addheader - add headers of
  infected and spam messages. End user can filter headers in
  his mail program, for example, storing spam messages in special
  folder.

--spamcgpd now analyse the new parameter spamcgpd_action in database.
  Users can change its value through the web interface.
  Actions are:
    0 - none (do nothing with message)
    1 - default action on spam detection (admin defined)
    2 - reject (send Undeliverable report to sender)
    3 - discard (silently delete message)
    4 - addheader (add mail header X-Spam-Status)
    5 - addheader (add mail header X-Spam-Status) and store it to Spam folder
    (must be created special Rule to filter this header)
        
--infected_header and spam_header. You can define your own headers for
  infected and spam messages.

--Squirrelmail spamassassin_sql plugin and php web-interface were updated 
  to allow user to choose the spam action. He can add the rule to store
  spam messages in IMAP folder named Spam in one click.
  Look into config.php to adjust several options. You must create 
  a special administrative account that has ability to update user
  rules, create folders and change folder subscriptions.
                 
--New options for configure. Now it can work either without any antivirus
  or without SpamAssassin.
  --with-antivirus=av_name      Anti-virus daemon name: [avp OR sophos OR no]
  --with-spamassassin=yes/no    Use SpamAssassin filter or not [yes]"
  --with-cgpro-home=PATH        path to CommuniGate Pro's root dir 
				[/var/CommuniGate]"
  --with-cgpro-settings=PATH    path to CommuniGate Pro's Settings dir 
				[cgpro-home/Settings]"
  --with-cgpro-submitted=PATH   path to CommuniGate Pro's Submitted dir 
				[cgpro-home/Submitted]"
 
--New options extra_spam_score and extra_spam_action.
  When a user hasn't defined any custom action (spamcgpd_action == 1),
  and counted spam_score of a message is higher than extra_spam_score,
  the extra_spam_action will be involved. Another words, when 
  spam_score is low the filter will simply add the header, but when
  it is high (e.g., domain is blacklisted) a message will be rejected.

--Ukrainian language notifications

--Option "spamcgpd_mail_aliases" in spamcgpd.conf Useful if you have
  a mail domain with several aliases. Then a user's settings for 
  SpamAssassin in the SQL database will be equal for the main domain and
  all these aliases.

--Solaris AVP response processing was simplified.
